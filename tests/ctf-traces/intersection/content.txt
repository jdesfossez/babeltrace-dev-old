The traces in this folder are designed to test the --packet-intersect feature.
Here is a description of all the traces:
- 3eventsintersect:
  2 streams, only 3 events in the middle of the trace intersect between the 2
  streams
- 3eventsintersectreverse
  Same as 3eventsintersect but switched the filenames to make sure the order
  of trace file open has no impact on the intersection detection
- nointersect
  No common time range between the 2 streams in this trace
- nostream
  No stream at all in the trace
- onestream
  Only one stream, so all events should intersect
